## About Me

<img src="/assets/images/maggie.jpg" alt="Myself" id="profile-pic" width="160" />
Since 2024, I am an Assistant Professor at the [Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en) in the [Foundational and Experimental Security](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/faculty-of-science/more-about/foundational-and-experimental-security-computer-science) group of the [Department of Computer Science](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science).
Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/comp/) at [the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/) and as an Experienced Researcher at [Ericsson Research Canada](https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/company-facts/ericsson-worldwide/canada). I received my B.E. and M.E. in Information Security from [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/en/), and hold a Ph.D. in Information and Systems Engineering from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/), Montreal, Canada, under the supervision of [Prof. Lingyu Wang](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~wang/).

My research interests include security metrics, software security, attack surface, cloud computing/5G security and privacy, and applied machine learning in security.
